# Introduction to Metagenomics - Session 2
## Learning Objective
1.	NCBI Database Proficiency: Develop skills to efficiently locate and interpret data on the [NCBI database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), including navigating to specific BioProject and SRA experiment pages.
2.	Data Retrieval from Published Papers: Gain the ability to identify and extract relevant raw data and metadata from published scientific papers.
3.	Metagenomic Sequencing Platforms: Learn about different sequencing platforms by analyzing their data characteristics, specifically focusing on [Illumina](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0198885921000628) and [Nanopore technologies](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3423).
4.	Taxonomic Analysis: Acquire practical experience in assigning taxonomic labels to sequencing reads using Kraken2 on [Tufts Galaxy](https://galaxy.cluster.tufts.edu/), and in converting and visualizing these labels with Krona.
5.	Data Comparison and Interpretation: Enhance skills in comparing visualized data with NCBI SRA information and drawing conclusions about sample composition.

## Exercise 1
### Objecttive: 
In this section, you will learn to navigate the NCBI database. This database is very extensive, and contains different pages based on the type of dataset stored. Specifically, you will learn to: locate BioProject pages, SRA experiment pages, and SRA Runs from published papers.
This is a very important skill for bioinformatics, as we build on the work of others....

### Instructions:
You will navigate through NCBI database to find the below information. 

1. Check this Paper and locate the bioproject ID from the text in paper [Evaluation of full-length nanopore 16S sequencing for detection of pathogens in microbial keratitis](https://peerj.com/articles/10778/)                
    * Clue: Bioproject ID is [PRJEB37709](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJEB37709/) below section "Data Availability"        
2. Find the answers for the following questions. Write down the answer on a piece or paper or using a text editor/notebook on your laptop or phone.        
    1. What is the link for this BioProject?             
    2. How many samples are there in this BioProject?
    3. How many SRA runs are there in this BioProject?        
    4. What is the sequencing platform for SRA run [ERR4836970](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=ERR4836970)
3. Repeat step 3 for the second paper:
