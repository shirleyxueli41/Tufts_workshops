# Introduction to Metagenomics - Session 2
## Learning Objective
1.	NCBI Database Proficiency: Develop skills to efficiently locate and interpret data on the NCBI database, including navigating to specific BioProject and SRA experiment pages.
2.	Data Retrieval from Published Papers: Gain the ability to identify and extract relevant raw data and metadata from published scientific papers.
3.	Metagenomic Sequencing Platforms: Learn about different sequencing platforms by analyzing their data characteristics, specifically focusing on Illumina and Nanopore technologies.
4.	Taxonomic Analysis: Acquire practical experience in assigning taxonomic labels to sequencing reads using Kraken2, and in converting and visualizing these labels with Krona.
5.	Data Comparison and Interpretation: Enhance skills in comparing visualized data with NCBI SRA information and drawing conclusions about sample composition.

## Exercise 1
### Objecttive: 
In this section, you will learn to navigate the NCBI database. This database is very extensive, and contains different pages based on the type of dataset stored. Specifically, you will learn to: locate BioProject pages, SRA experiment pages, and SRA Runs from published papers.
This is a very important skill for bioinformatics, as we build on the work of others....
